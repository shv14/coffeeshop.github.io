                <p class="smalltext">Coffee is a beverage prepared from roasted coffee beans. Darkly colored, bitter,
                    and slightly acidic, coffee
                    has a stimulating effect on humans, primarily due to its caffeine content. It has the highest sales
                    in the
                    world market for hot drinks.

                    The seeds of the Coffea plant's fruits are separated to produce unroasted green coffee beans. The
                    beans are
                    roasted and then ground into fine particles that are typically steeped in hot water before being
                    filtered
                    out, producing a cup of coffee. It is usually served hot, although chilled or iced coffee is common.
                    Coffee
                    can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, caffè latte, or
                    already-brewed canned coffee). Sugar, sugar substitutes, milk, and cream are often added to mask the
                    bitter
                    taste or enhance the flavor.

            <p class="smalltext">Cinnamon brings with it the smell and flavor of fall, and is a delicious addition to
                hot beverages. For taste alone, adding cinnamon to your brew is a great idea. But you’ve probably heard
                that cinnamon coffee is also healthy. Something that tastes amazing and is good for you? What nirvana is
                this?

            <p class="smalltext">A latte or caffè latte is a milk coffee that boasts a silky layer of foam as a real
                highlight to the drink. A true latte will be made up of one or two shots of espresso, steamed milk and a
                final, thin layer of frothed milk on top. These elements combined result in a balanced milky coffee that
                possesses an aesthetically pleasing look and a smooth texture.

            <p class="smalltext">Espresso is a delicious concentrated form of coffee, served in shots and it’s often the
                coffee base of many other beverages, such as cappuccino, latte, americano and macchiato. An espresso is
                intense and bold, but nonetheless delicious, and the espresso is usually served in small demitasse-style
                cups for this reason.
